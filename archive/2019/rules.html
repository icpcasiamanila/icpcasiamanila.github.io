        <h1>The Contest</h1>
        <p>
          Ten (10) or more algorithmic problems will be posed for teams to solve in
          five (5) hours. While the contest is scheduled for five hours, the
          Regional Contest Director has the authority to alter the length of the
          contest in the even of unforeseen difficulties. Should the contest duration
          be altered, every attempt will be made to notify contestants in a timely
          and uniform manner.
        </p>
        <p>
          Problems will be posed in English. During the contest , all communications
          from contest officials to contestants will be in English.
        </p>
        <p>
          A contestant may submit a claim of ambiguity or error in a problem
          statement by submitting a <em>clarification request</em> using the
          contest management system. If the judges agree that ambiguity is present
          in the problem, a broadcast of the clarification will be made to all
          teams.
        </p>
        <p>
          Should a contestant require use of the restroom during the contest
          proper, the contestant will be accompanied by a designated usher.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h1>Submissions</h1>
        <p>
          Solutions to problems submitted for judging are called
          <em><strong>runs</strong></em>. Each run is judged as accepted or
          rejected, and the team is notified of the results. A problem is solved
          when it is accepted by the judges. To accept or reject a submission,
          judges will compile and test the program with a different set of test
          data which have been prepared in advance.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Rejected runs</em> will be marked as follows:
          <ul>
            <li>
              Runtime Error: the program crashed (runtime error) when processing
              the test data.
            </li>
            <li>
              Time Limit Exceeded: The program took more than the specified time
              limit to produce output and properly complete execution.
            </li>
            <li>
              Wrong Answer: The program did not produce the correct output.
              Presentation errors (e.g. too many whitespace) will be marked as
              Wrong Answer.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <p>No other details will be given to each response.</p>
        <p>
          Public notification of accepted runs may be suspended at an appropriate
          time (typically during the last hour of the contest) to keep the final
          results secret. A general announcement to that effect will be made
          during the contest. Notification of rejected runs will continue to be
          made to the team until the end of the contest.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h1>Scoring and Ranks</h1>
        <p>
          A problem is solved when it is accepted by the judges. The judges are
          solely responsible for accepting or rejecting submitted runs. In
          consultation with the judges, the Regional Contest Director determines
          the winners of the regional contest. The Regional Contest Director and
          judges are empowered to adjust for or adjudicate unforeseen events and
          conditions. Their decisions are final.
        </p>
        <p>
          Teams are ranked according to the most number of problems solved. Teams
          who solve the same number of problems are ranked by least total time.
          The total time is the sum of time consumed for each problem solved. The
          time consumed for a solved problem is the time elapsed from the
          beginning of the contest to the submittal of the first accepted run
          plus 20 penalty minutes for every previously rejected run for that
          problem. There is no time consumed for a problem that is not solved.
        </p>
        <p>
          All inquiries, concerns, and protests on the results must be brought to
          the attention of the Regional Contest Director and the Chief of Judges
          within three (3) days of the competition's closing ceremony before
          elevating such concerns tot he ICPC Foundation.

          workstations until so directed by the Regional Contest Director.

          support staff may advise contestants on system-related problems, such
          as explaining system error messages.
        </p>
        <p>
          A team may be <strong>disqualified</strong> due to any form of cheating
          or any attempt at cheating. Submitting a solution which is not made by
          your own team is considered cheating. A team may also be disqualified
          for any act that jeopardizes the contest (e.g. hacking or tampering
          with equipment, dislodging electrical or network cables, distracting
          behavior, etc.). All teams are expected to uphold sportsmanship and the
          spirit of fair competition.
